\item{\code{ type }}{ The type of the Area, as referenced in the \code{zone_types} table (either \code{PAR} or \code{WARD}) }
\item{\code{ zone_id }}{ The ONS identifier for the Zone }
\item{\code{ OA }}{ The ONS identifier for the Output Area the Zone is included into }
\item{\code{ sibling }}{ The code for the Area that appears in the \code{lookups} table having the same parent zone}
\item{\code{ parent }}{ The code for the parent zone the Area should belong to }
}
}

\description{
This dataset list the lookups for those \code{PAR} and \code{WARD} zones missing from the \code{lookups} table,
because of them being smaller than the \emph{Output Areas} they fall into
but with smaller area of a similar zone competing for the same Output Area
(which is the one comparing in \code{lookups}).
